# Lab 1 - Creating a Pulsar environment and interacting with the broker

In this lab we will be interacting with a Pulsar broker via the pulsar-client cli. To run the cli your environment needs to have the Java runtime installed. The first modules will ensure your local environment is configured properly and confirm the Pulsar binaries are accessible. With those requirements complete, you will test messaging, message augmentation, and message automations throughout the modules.

All of the examples is this lab assume you are running on a bash compatible client. To open a client:

- Windows (using the WSL): Open up a PowerShell window >> Type "wsl" >> A new terminal window will open
- MacOS: Press the "Command" button and the space bar simultaneously >> type "Terminal" >> Double click "Terminal" in the left sidebar
- Ubuntu: Press Ctrl+Alt+T

## Lab modules ([get started](./binaries.md))

1. Installing binaries and running a Pulsar broker
1. Pub/Sub
1. Augmenting message text
1. Filtering messages to other topics
1. Adding a source connector
