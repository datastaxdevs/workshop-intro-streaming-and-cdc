# workshop-intro-streaming-and-cdc
We will visit the basics of change data capture (CDC) and why it's become so popular recently - with CDC, developers create smarter applications when real-time data is connected to the whole data ecosystem. During the workshop we will highlight use cases that make it your go-to solution when modernizing applications, getting more value out of your data (real-time), and joining new machine learning techniques with old applications.  We will introduce you to Apache Pulsar, show you how to enable the CDC feature in Datastax Astra, how to set up Astra Streaming, and (of course) how to get it all working together!
